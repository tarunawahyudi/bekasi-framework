# Bekasi Framework
### Typescript Framework for MVC

[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-2.0-blue.svg)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

My TypeScript MVC Framework is a lightweight web framework built using TypeScript, inspired by CodeIgniter. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing a structured and modular approach to developing web applications.

## Key Features

- **TypeScript Support:** Leverage the benefits of static typing for enhanced code quality.
- **MVC Architecture:** Organize your code into Models, Views, and Controllers for a clear separation of concerns.
- **Easy Installation:** Quick setup using npm for seamless integration into your projects.
- **Development Mode:** Utilize the watch mode for efficient development with automatic code reloading.
